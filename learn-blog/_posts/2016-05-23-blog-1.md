title: Why Did You Decide to Learn Software Devlopement?
---

Software development is something that I've always wanted to do, but I've
never been in the position to do so.  I dropped out of college several years
ago and have worked several jobs since then.  Working as a drafter, barista,
coffee roaster, substation technician, etc.  When work began to slow down
and was already unhappy with my latest job I knew it was time for a career change
and software development had always been on my mind.  Since, I had family to
support I knew that 2-4 years of college would have taken too much time and
money.  So I decided to look for other forms of education rather than a
traditional college.  I first came across Udacity and enrolled in their
Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.  Learning to code for the first time was
extremely challenging, but very fun at the same time.  After finishing with
the Nanodegree from Udacity I knew I still had a lot to learn if I wanted to
find a job, which led me to the Flatiron School!
